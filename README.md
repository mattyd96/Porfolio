# My Portfolio

This is my portfolio to showcase my work and gained skills in web development. This will be added to and modified as I learn more and develop more projects.

This porfolio has been developed during a Full-stack bootcamp and complies with the  following Acceptance criteria

GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work 
WHEN I load their portfolio 

THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them 

WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation  
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section 
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work 
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications 
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application 
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others 
WHEN I click on the images of the applications 
THEN I am taken to that deployed application 
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices 
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
